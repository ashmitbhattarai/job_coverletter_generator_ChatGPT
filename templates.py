{applicant_tools}

% INCLUDE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN YOUR COVER LETTER RESPONSE:
- For first paragraph, start the cover letter with applicants introduction: "I am {applicant_name}, a {job_role_name} by profession with {years_of_experience} years of experience." then write in brief applicant's best achievement relevant to the role. It should be engaging and impactful but accurate for the applicant.

- In second paragraph, start with "Of many relevant experiences as {job_role_name}.." then write about the relevant work done by applicant with relevant tools and technologies, in bullet points. The similar experiences or work done should come from Work Experiences and technical skills parsed and understood from above.

- Next, in third paragrah, write about working with similar projects from list below which matches job requirements under "JOB DETAILS". Then, write about different different tools related to {job_role_name} that applicant is familiar with as well.

- Write a conclusion by: highlighting applicant's fitting characteristics to the role, exlaborating on good work ethics and being part of a team and value the applicant bring to the team.


% TAKE CARE TO CONSIDER FOLLOWING

- The cover letter must be engaging but focused on client's job details and how applicant is best fit
- Take reference from sample below and add information in relevant:

As mentioned before, I have 5+ year of experience as Senior Data Scientist and NLP engineer at Perceptytx inc, USA. Also, I have developed NLP based models using Bi-directional LSTM, BERT, Roberta, BART (Summary and Topic Modelling) and more. I have expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistical Analytics and Software Development. I can research, investigate, formulate, design, train and deploy any Machine Learning or Deep Learning models end-to-end independently or as part of a team. I have always worked in an Agile Team and worn multiple hats of Data Engineer, MLOps and sometimes Scrum Master.
As a previous Top-Rated Freelancer in Upwork, I have worked with multiple AI centric companies and start-ups before as a long-term contractor majority of which lead to me be hired for full time roles. Being a Master in Data Science graduate from Macquire University Sydney, I am up to date with old and current Deep Learning tech and I have up-to date Machine Learning and Deep Learning certifications in AWS and Coursera to support that as well.

What I bring to the role, is my expertise and experience to build scalable and robust AI Solutions. I have built Text Classification and Topic Modelling solutions using Deep Learning (Transformers and LSTM), Image Classification (using Faster RCNN), Statistical Models and Machine Learning solutions for Survey Managers to forecast certain target variables (built a collection of Auto Tunable ML models for Regression and Classification using GLMs and XGBoost). The ML solution will automatically find a suitable model and train a fairly accurate model and can be further tuned by an expert.
